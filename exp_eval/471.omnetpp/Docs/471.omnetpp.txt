Benchmark Description

   The benchmark performs discrete event simulation of a large Ethernet
   network. The simulation is based on the OMNeT++ discrete event simulation
   system ([1]www.omnetpp.org), a generic and open simulation framework.
   OMNeT++'s primary application area is the simulation of communication
   networks, but its generic and flexible architecture allows for its use in
   other areas such as the simulation of IT systems, queueing networks,
   hardware architectures or business processes as well. The Ethernet model
   used in this benchmark is publicly available from the address given in the
   References.

   For the reference workload, the simulated network models a large Ethernet
   campus backbone, with several smaller LANs of various sizes hanging off
   each backbone switch. The model contains altogether about 8000 computers
   (hosts), and 900 switches and hubs. It mixes all kinds of Ethernet
   technology: Gigabit Ethernet, 100Mb full duplex, 100Mb half duplex, 10Mb
   UTP, 10Mb bus ("thin Ethernet"), switched hubs, repeating hubs.

   The training workload models a smaller LAN with several hubs and busses.

   The model is accurate in the sense that the CSMA/CD protocol of Ethernet
   and the Ethernet frame are faithfully modelled. The host model contains a
   traffic generator which implements a generic request-response based
   protocol. (Higher layer protocols are not modelled in detail.) With
   appropriate configuration, the traffic generator can be tuned become a
   rough model for protocols such as SMB/CIFS (the Windows file sharing
   protocol), HTTP, or a database client-server protocol.

   A pointer to the detailed documentation of the model can be found among
   the References.

Input Description

   The topology of the network and structure of hosts, switches and hubs are
   described in NED files (NED is the network description language of
   OMNeT++.) Operation of the Ethernet MAC, traffic generator etc. are in
   C++.

   Several model parameters are specified in the omnetpp.ini file. These
   parameters include the number of switches on the backbone, the number of
   small, medium and large LANs on each backbone switch, the number of hosts
   in small, medium and large LANs as well as switch, host configuration and
   parameters of the traffic model. Request and reply lengths are configured
   in omnetpp.ini as intuniform(50,1400) and truncnormal(5000,5000) for the
   reference input. The volume of the traffic can most easily be controlled
   with the time period between sending requests; this is currently set in
   omnetpp.ini to exponential(0.33) (that is, average 3 requests per second)
   for the reference input. This already causes frames to be dropped in some
   of the backbone switches, so the network is a bit overloaded with the
   current settings.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Output Description

   The model generates extensive statistics. MACs (and most other model
   components too) write statistics into the omnetpp.sca file at the end of
   the simulation: number of frames sent, received, dropped, etc. These are
   only basic statistics; however, if all nodes were allowed to record them,
   omnetpp.sca would grow to about 28 megabytes. To make the output more
   reasonable in size, recording statistics is only enabled in a few nodes
   ("writeScalars" parameter in omnetpp.ini.)

   The easiest way to view and plot the data in omnetpp.sca is the Scalars
   tool of OMNeT++ 3.0, but because the file is a simple text file, a
   spreadsheet program (e.g. Microsoft Excel or OpenOffice) will also do.

   The model could also record output vectors (omnetpp.vec), but this feature
   is disabled in omnetpp.ini because the generated file can easily reach
   gigabyte sizes.

Portability issues fixed subsequent to the release of SPEC CPU2006 V1.0

     * New with CPU2006 V1.1, renamed random.h to avoid clashes with system
       headers.
