0. Requirements
---------------

libquantum needs a C compiler with complex number support (C99
prefered). A recent gcc (>=2.95) will do the job. Furthermore, the
host must support 64-bit integers, even if it is not a 64-bit machine.

If you encounter any difficulties while building, installing or using
libquantum, we would like to hear from you. Just send a mail to
libquantum@enyo.de.


1. Configure and Make
---------------------

As libquantum was created using autoconf and libtool, this step should
not be a major problem. Simply extract the tarball to a directory:

	tar xzvf libquantum-0.2.2.tar.gz

Next, run the configure script:

	./configure

Now you can build the beast:

	make

By now, you can create two demo programs which show Shor's factoring
algorithm and Grover's search algorithm:

	make demos

For the Shor algorithm demo, the number to be factored is given on the
command line as the first parameter. To factor 15, simply type:

	./shor 15

The demo for Grover's algorithm requires the number of the marked
element (i.e. the desired result of the search) as the first argument
on the command line. The number of qubits may be given as a second
arguments. To mark element No. 42 in a database of 10 qubits (which
means 2^10 = 1024 elements):

	./grover 42 10

To see which quantum operations a program or an algorithm actually
performs, the concept of quantum object code (quobcode) has been
developed. Two helper tools can be built by typing

	make quobtools

This will create two programs, quobdump and quobprint. quobdump can
generate the object code directly from a program, which does not need
to be recompiled. It requires as arguements the file to which the
object code shall be written and the name of the program for which the
quobcode shall be created (plus the arguments for this program). For
example:

	./quobdump output_file ./shor 15

Quobcode files are binary data files. quobprint can be used to view
these files and takes the quobcode file as the only argument:

	./quobprint output_file

Each line of output contains the number of the operation, the type of
operation and its arguments.


2. Installation of the library
------------------------------

For this step you will need to have superuser privileges. Just type

	make install

to get libquantum installed into the default directory, which is
usually /usr/local/bin. Note that on some systems this directories is
not in the standard search path for libraries. Take a look at the
output of the last command to get some advice on how to deal with
this.

To install the quobcode tools on your system type

	make quobtools_install


3. Writing your own programs
----------------------------

You can use libquantum as any other C library. Just #include
<quantum.h> in your source file and link the library into your program
with the linker flag -lquantum.
